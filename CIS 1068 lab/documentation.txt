______________________File System____________________

Student: Anh Nguyen - CIS 3207

This project provides us chance to implement a real File System based on FAT16 Design
The Design for this project are:
    - 8 blocks (4096 bytes) for File Allocation Table, each entry will store pointer
      to next block (2 bytes)
    - 2 blocks (1024 bytes) for Directory Entry Table which store filename, their first
      block in FAT and meta data, each entry will be 32 bytes
    - The rest are for Data, which will be 1048576 bytes in total

Code Structure:
-I used memory mapped file I/O in this project and divide the drive into 3 portions: 
 fatMap , dirTable and dataMap
-The project consists of 6 main IOCS functions and an User Interface to experiment with it
 +) create:
           -search for file in root directory, if already exist generate error
           -else: create an entry, update Dir Table, update FAT, add the filename to the current
                  directory block
           -if the file is a directory, update currentDir to indicate we are in the directory after
            creation
 +) delete:
           -search for file in root directory, if not exist, generate error
           -remove entry from dir Table
           -Update FAT and the filename in current directory block
 +) open: 
           -find the first block of the file
 +) close: -go back to root directory
 +) read:  -from the 1st block, navigate all the other blocks and read it into a buffer
 +) write: -from the 1st block, navigate to the last block, find new empty block to inser
            data, then update FAT, meta data.

Project Execution:
-press make and ./serv and the user interface will pop up

Result and test case:
-Included in test.doc file
